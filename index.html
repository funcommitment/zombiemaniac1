<img src="file:///C:/Users/DELL/Downloads/35.jpg" alt= height="400" width ="400"><br>
<i><p> Well here is a bonus for you all another one of my favourite zombie movie.What could possibly go wrong when three buddies (Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller, Joey Morgan) decide to join the<b> Boy Scouts?</b> When bloodthirsty, undead ghouls invade their once-peaceful town, it's up to kindhearted Ben, quick-witted Carter and class clown Augie to save the day. With help from Denise (Sarah Dumont), a beautiful but tough cocktail waitress, the boys must put their scouting skills to the ultimate test to save mankind and earn their zombie-killing badges.I had trouble believing Landon and company were going to be able to pull this type of horror-comedy hybrid off. But they do, more or less, the strengths of the performances and the number of solid laughs winning me over. Demerit badges all round.</p></i>
